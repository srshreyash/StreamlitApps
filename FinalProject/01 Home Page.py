                - The most basic model that has been implemented for a long time for time series forecasting.
                - Different variants are available to account for Seasonality and Trends in data.
                - Works well with Univariate data.

                - Advanced Deep Learning model that is primarily being used for text translation by Google, FB and many other organizations.
                - Works well with complex input and multivariate analysis.
            - **FBProphet**:
                - Facebook's in-house time series forecasting model.
                - Developed and tuned with accounting for recent developments in statistical modelling techniques.
